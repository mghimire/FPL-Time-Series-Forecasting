# FPL-Time-Series-Forecasting
## Introduction

The **Fantasy Premier League (FPL)** is an online fantasy football game based on the **English Premier League (EPL)**. Players build teams of players from the EPL and compete against each other in pursuit of the highest accumulated score over the course of a league season.

A fantasy player receives a score based on the performance of the individual players on their team per **Gameweek (GW)**. This performance is delineated in the form of points, which can be earned or lost via various game statistics such as goals, assists, and saves. These points per statistic are awarded differently for players of different positions. Details on the point rubric can be found under the scoring tab on the [FPL Website](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/help/rules). There is also further information there for those who may be interested in learning more about the league or participating in the game.

The objective of this project is to use statistical and machine learning tools to try and forecast the performance of FPL players.

# FPL Time Series Forecasting
## Introduction

The **Fantasy Premier League (FPL)** is an online fantasy football game based on the **English Premier League (EPL)**. Players build teams of players from the EPL and compete against each other in pursuit of the highest accumulated score over the course of a league season.

A fantasy player receives a score based on the performances of the individual players on their team per **Gameweek (GW)**. This performance is delineated in the form of points, which can be earned or lost via various game statistics such as goals, assists, and saves. These points per statistic are awarded differently for players of different positions. Details on the point rubric can be found under the scoring tab on the [FPL Website](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/help/rules). There is also further information there for those who may be interested in learning more about the league or participating in the game.

The objective of this project is to use **statistical** and **machine learning (ML)** tools to try and forecast the performance of FPL players.

### Disclaimer:
Although I am an avid enjoyer of FPL and the EPL in general, I do not endorse the game or the league in any capacity. This repository is intended to be a purely academic exploration. I do not take any responsibility for the use and results of the tools presented in this project. However, if you find any success with this model, please feel free to share. Conversely, if you find anomalous results or mistakes in the code, please notify me. Collaborations are welcome and adjacent exploration is highly encouraged.

## Theoretical Outline

This study is based on **Time Series Forecasting** and **ML techniques** surrounding the subject. **Non-ML statistical tools** such as **autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)** and **seasonal decomposition of time series (STL)** may also be used at times in feature-engineering or cross-examining the performance of the **ML techniques**. However, the primary goal of this study is to use **ML techniques**, such as **recurrent neural networks (RNNs)** and **long short-term memory networks (LSTMs)**, to try and optimize accuracy and consistency in predicting FPL player scores.
